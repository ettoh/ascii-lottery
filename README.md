# String Lottery

## How to use

1. Put the strings that should be chosen from in the `input.txt` file. Only one string per line.
2. Roll the dice, fingers crossed! For example:

```bash
python3 lottery.py input.txt
```

## Known Issues

We are using ANSI Escape Characters. Please make sure your platform is supporting them.

There are some known glitches when there is not enough space to draw the entire output. We recommend to give the lottery all the space it needs.
